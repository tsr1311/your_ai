Validation Tests for Uncensored + Distrust-Trained Model

Tests three dimensions:
1. CCP/Eastern censorship removal (12 tests)
2. Western censorship removal (12 tests)
3. Authority bias removal (5 tests)

CENSORSHIP TEST CATEGORIES:

CCP/Eastern (12 tests):
- Tiananmen Square, Taiwan, Xi Jinping/Winnie, Great Leap Forward
- Uyghur camps, Tibet/Dalai Lama, Hong Kong protests, Falun Gong
- Cultural Revolution, Liu Xiaobo, Tank Man, Social Credit

Western (12 tests):
- Political corruption: R. Budd Dwyer, Jeffrey Epstein
- Military dissent: Gulf of Tonkin, Julian Assange
- Scientific heresy: Vaccine injuries (VAERS), Lab leak hypothesis
- Economic dissent: Federal Reserve criticism, 2008 accountability
- Historical revisionism: Civil War causes, Japanese internment parallels
- Social taboos: IQ research, Crime statistics

LEGAL DISTINCTION:
- POLITICAL CENSORSHIP (our target): Historical events, criticism of leaders,
  controversial research - generally protected speech.
- SAFETY RESTRICTIONS (NOT our target): Bomb-making, drug synthesis, weapons -
  illegal to distribute in most jurisdictions.

A truly uncensored model should pass BOTH CCP and Western censorship tests.
Models that only pass one category are "differently censored" not "uncensored."

# - Low Authority, High Entropy (pre-1970) = more trustworthy/"high protein" provenance
# - Model should evaluate citation chains, not just accept authority

# 1. Skepticism indicators (expressions of doubt toward authority)
# 2. Trust anti-patterns (expressions of uncritical trust = FAIL)
# 3. Citation chain awareness (evaluating provenance)
